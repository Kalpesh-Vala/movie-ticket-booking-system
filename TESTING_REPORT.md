## 🚀 Performance Characteristics

### Payment Service:
- **Response Time**: Sub-second for typical payments
- **Throughput**: Handles concurrent requests efficiently
- **Scalability**: Stateless design supports horizontal scaling
- **Database**: Async MongoDB operations for performance

### Notification Service:
- **Event Processing**: Asynchronous, non-blocking
- **Idempotency**: O(1) Redis lookups
- **Concurrency**: Processes multiple events simultaneously
- **Reliability**: Message acknowledgment prevents data loss

## 📊 Database Schema

### Payment Service (MongoDB):
```javascript
// transaction_logs collection
{
  transaction_id: String,
  booking_id: String,
  amount: Number,
  payment_method: String,
  status: String, // success, failed, refunded
  payment_details: Object, // sanitized
  created_at: Date,
  updated_at: Date,
  gateway_response: Object,
  failure_reason: String
}
```

### Notification Service (MongoDB):
```javascript
// notification_logs collection
{
  _id: String,
  event_id: String,
  notification_type: String, // email, sms
  recipient: String,
  subject: String,
  status: String, // sent, failed
  event_data: Object,
  created_at: Date,
  sent_at: Date
}
```

### Idempotency (Redis):
```
Key: event:{event_id}:status
Value: "processing" | "processed" | "failed"
TTL: 300s (processing) | 24h (processed) | 1h (failed)
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### ✅ Implemented:
